Hi everyone,

I'm a self-taught aspiring frontend developer based in Selangor, Malaysia. While I'm overwhelmed by the vast amount of online tutorials available, I find it challenging to solve coding problems independently without guidance. To address this, I believe practicing through exercises is crucial.

I recently discovered the book "Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills" and decided to use it to enhance my frontend development skills. I plan to tackle each exercise by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps and solving them individually.

This approach aims to improve my problem-solving abilities and solidify my understanding of frontend development concepts.
